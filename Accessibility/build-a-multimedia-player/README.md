# Multimedia Player — Accessibility & HTML Structure

This project demonstrates best practices in accessible multimedia and semantic HTML.

## Accessibility Highlights

- **Semantic Headings:** Uses `<h1>` for the main title and `<h2>` for section headings, improving screen reader navigation.
- **ARIA Labels:** Both audio and video elements include clear `aria-label` attributes, describing their content for assistive technologies.
- **Captions Support:** `<track>` element in the video points to a `.vtt` file for accessible captions, aiding users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
- **Transcript Section:** Offers a text transcript within a `<section>`, making multimedia content accessible to users with auditory impairments or those who prefer text.

## HTML Structure

- Divides content into logical `<section>` elements for audio, video, and transcript — clearly grouping related content.
- Uses semantic elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<track>`) to ensure meaning and readability.
- Each media element uses the proper source and type tags for compatibility.
