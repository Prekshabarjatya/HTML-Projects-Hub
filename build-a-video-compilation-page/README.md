Introduction
I built this Video Compilation Page as part of the FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Curriculum. The goal of this project was to introduce the basics of Front End Web Development—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—using clear sections and embedded tutorial videos.

Features
- The app has a single main element within the body, ensuring clean and semantic structure.
- It starts with an h1 title and a paragraph introducing front end web development.
- There are three sections: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Each section begins with an h2 heading.
- I provided a brief description for each topic.

Each section also includes a relevant embedded YouTube video to help beginners visualize core concepts.
