# Event Hub

This is my Event Hub projectâ€”a web app built using semantic HTML to showcase upcoming and past events in a clear, accessible way.

## Features

- Semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Navigation links for Upcoming and Past Events
- Sections for listing event details with headings, descriptions, and images
- Custom styling and content to give the app a personal touch

## Objective

Designed to fulfill specific user stories and pass HTML semantic structure tests, this project helps practice best practices for organizing and presenting web content.
