# HTML Course – Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum

This repository is my personal collection of projects from the **HTML Course** in the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum by freeCodeCamp.  
It includes every project I’ve built throughout the course, giving me a way to track my progress, document my work, and revisit key concepts whenever I need.

## About This Course

The HTML module forms the foundation of my journey to becoming a full stack developer.  
Through hands-on labs and workshops, I’ve been learning how to:

- Structure webpages using core HTML elements and attributes  
- Work with media: images, audio, video, SVGs, and iframes  
- Apply semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO  
- Build forms and tables with validation and proper structure  
- Follow accessibility best practices, including ARIA roles  

My goal by the end of this module is to write clean, accessible, and production-ready HTML — code that can reliably serve as the backbone for any modern web application.
