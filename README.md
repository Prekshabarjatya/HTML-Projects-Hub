# HTML Course â€“ Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum

This repository is my personal collection of projects from the **HTML Course** of the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum by FreeCodeCamp.  
Iâ€™ve converted all the **labs** and **workshops** into structured project folders, each with its own README and checklist, so I can track my progress and revisit concepts whenever needed.

## ðŸ“– About This Course

This HTML module lays down the foundation for becoming a full stack developer.  
Through hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve been learning to:

- Build the basic structure of a webpage with HTML elements and attributes  
- Work with media: images, audio, video, SVGs, and iframes  
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO  
- Create forms, tables, and implement validation  
- Apply accessibility best practices and ARIA roles  

By the end of this module, I aim to be confident in writing clean, accessible, and production-ready HTML that can serve as the backbone for any web application.
