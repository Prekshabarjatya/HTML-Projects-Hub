# Build a Recipe Page

## Overview
In this lab, I created a simple recipe page for chocolate chip cookies using HTML.  
The project demonstrates how to structure content with headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and other core HTML elements.

## Objectives
- Practice structuring a webpage with headings and paragraphs  
- Use the `<img>` element to display an image with alternative text  
- Organize ingredients with an unordered list  
- Present step-by-step instructions with an ordered list  
- Reinforce the use of semantic HTML for clear content presentation
