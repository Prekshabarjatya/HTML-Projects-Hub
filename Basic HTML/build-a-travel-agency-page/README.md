# Travel Agency HTML Page Project  

Hi! This is a simple HTML project I built to practice webpage structuring.  
Itâ€™s a mock travel agency page showcasing **Italy** as a destination.  

## Features  
- Semantic HTML with headings, lists, and figures  
- Basic SEO with `<title>` and `<meta>` description  
- Accessible images with `alt` text  
- External links with `target="_blank"`  

## What I Learned  
- Writing clean, semantic HTML  
- Organizing content into sections  
- Adding accessible images and links
